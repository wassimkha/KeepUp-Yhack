# KeepUp

KeepUp is a website that allows for communication between students and professors during lectures. It allows the professor to gauge the understanding of the material in real-time while providing students a platform to pose questions. It allows students to upvote questions asked by their peers that they would like to hear answered, making it easy for a professor to know which questions to prioritize.

## Our inspiration

As university students, we have been noticing issues with the very large class sizes. With lectures often being taught to over 400 students, it becomes very difficult and anxiety-provoking to speak up when you don't understand the content. As well, with classes of this size, professors do not have time to answer every student who raises their hand. This raises the problem of professors not being able to tell if students are following the lecture, and not answering questions efficiently. Our hack addresses these issues by providing a real-time communication environment between the class and the professor. KeepUp has the potential to increase classroom efficiency and improve student experiences worldwide.

## Getting Started

Visit keepup.space to get started. The platform offers two different perspectives; the student or the teacher view. As a student, you can share your general understanding of the lecture material by using the thumbs up and down buttons. This allows the professor to see a real-time data chart of the distribution of students' understanding of the material. As a student you can also pose questions by typing them in and hitting 'Submit Question'. The question will then be added to a queue of questions being asked by people in your class. Students have the option to upvote other questions that they also want to have answered, and the queue of questions will be sorted with those with the most upvotes at the top for the professor. From the teacher's view, along with the data chart, ou will also see the two questions that currently have the most upvotes. Questions disappear after 10 minutes of inactivity (not receiving any upvotes).
